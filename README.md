# Homelab

This repository contains configuration for all services hosted on my home server.

Services:
 - Immich
 - Copyparty
 - Calibre-Web-Automated
 - Home Assistant
 - MC server

To do:
 - config versioning for all services (with env variables if possible)
 - robust backup strategy
 - Github Actions automations
    - goal:  automate as much as possible starting with just services. Want to be able to spin up a new server from scratch as easy aspossible (including loading data from backup).
